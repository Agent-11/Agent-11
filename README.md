My name is Agent X in most places, Agent-11 is my kind of alternative name.

[![Agent's GitHub stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=Agent-11)](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats)

Here are some facts about me:

- I'm a lead developer for sm64ex-coop
- Creator of very popular mods for it like Day Night Cycle and Flood
- My favorite languages are C# and JavaScript
- I have background knowledge with using Unity
- My least favorite language is Java
- I like writing optimized code that looks good and runs fast

I am interested in 90s 3D graphics and games like DOOM, Quake, Half-Life or SM64 to name a few. Their underlying engines and ways they were programmed intrigue me a lot.

SM64 mod project developer, I mainly work on [sm64ex-coop](https://github.com/djoslin0/sm64ex-coop) and I have also contributed to [Retro64](https://github.com/Retro64Mod/Retro64Mod), [Saturn](https://github.com/Llennpie/Saturn) and some more repos.
