My name is Agent X in most places, Agent-11 is my kind of alternative name.

Here are some facts about me:

- My favorite languages are C# and JavaScript
- I know how to use Unity
- My least favorite language is Java
- Active sm64ex-coop modder, I learned Lua this way
- I like writing fast code

I am interested in 90s 3D games like DOOM, Quake, Half-Life or SM64 to name a few. Their underlying engines and ways they were programmed also interest me.

SM64 mod project developer, I mainly work on [sm64js](https://github.com/sm64js/sm64js) and [sm64ex-coop](https://github.com/djoslin0/sm64ex-coop). I have also contributed to [Retro64](https://github.com/Retro64Mod/Retro64Mod), [Saturn](https://github.com/Llennpie/Saturn) and more
