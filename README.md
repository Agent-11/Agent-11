My name is Agent X in most places, Agent-11 is my kind of alternative name.

[![Agent's GitHub stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=Agent-11)](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats)

Here are some facts about me:

- Favorite languages are C# and JavaScript
- Least favorite language is Java
- I know Lua from sm64ex-coop mod creation
- Writing code that runs fast is my thing

I am interested in Retro 3D and by proxy games like DOOM, Quake, Half-Life and SM64 to name a few. Their underlying engines also interest me, DOOM and Quake's engines especially.

SM64 mod project developer, I mainly work on [sm64js](https://github.com/sm64js/sm64js) and [sm64ex-coop](https://github.com/djoslin0/sm64ex-coop). I have also contributed to [Retro64](https://github.com/Retro64Mod/Retro64Mod), [Saturn](https://github.com/Llennpie/Saturn) and more

I also have a three.js game but I haven't worked on it in a while: [Maze 95 JS](https://github.com/maze95/maze95-js)
